Solution

a. (Output when the program is executed)

    Output if DEBUG is defined:
    Value of i: 1
    Value of j: 2
    Value of k: 3
    Value of i + j: 3
    Value of 2 * i + j - k: 1

b. Output when #define is removed from testdebug.
    
    Output if DEBUG is not defined:

c. Reason why the output of (a) and (b) are diff

    Because the DEBUG macro was left undefined while debug.h was added to testdebug.c, 
    the PRINT_DEBUG macro was defined as a macro with no effect, 
    and the preprocessor conditional statements also relied on the definition of DEBUG.

d. 

    Yes. The PRINT_DEBUG macro's definition relies on the definition of DEBUG. 
    If DEBUG is defined after PRINT_DEBUG is defined, it will have no effect on the definition of PRINT_DEBUG.
